This folder represents new folder structure as we start working on Proseal.
'Pages' folder was created to separate new components/pages/providers etc. from other content in codebase in hopes to imporve how to structure things.

Full outline of new folder strcuture can be found in main readme

Run `npx generate-react-cli component MyNewPage --path=src/common/pages` - this will create a new folder `src/common/pages` with `MyNewPage.tsx` and `MyNewPage.test.tsx`
