This folder represents new folder structure as we start working on Proseal.

'UI' folder will hold 'dummy' ui elements with no business logic.

Run `npx generate-react-cli component MyNewUIComponent --path=src/ui` - this will create a new folder `src/ui` with `MyNewUIComponent.tsx` and `MyNewUIComponent.test.tsx`
